Made with sweat, tears, [nanoc][], [Bootstrap][], [Font Awesome][fontawesome]
and [Bootswatch Cerulean][bootswatch].

Proudly powered by [Debian][], [nginx][] and [KVM][].

Thanks to everyone who made possible the Open Source @ Azzurra project possible
(in no particular order):

* vjt
* Mav
* Gastaman
* Shaka
* debiAn
* INT24
* city_hunter
* Sonic
* insomniac
* Wolf7
* snagg

Thanks to the fine folks of #altrove for the countless laughs.

Last but not least, extra special thanks to Fairy for enduring my bad temper
during each release sprint and the extra dose of swearing whenever I find a bug ;-)
